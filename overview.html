  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
      Particles are an important part of effects work, because they allow
      free-form information in 3D space. Unfortunately, there is no standard
      format for particles akin to Wavefront .obj.  Most animation systems
      have their own proprietary particle formats. For example Maya uses the
      binary and ascii particle database formats .pdb and .pda file formats.
      Houdini uses the .geo and .bgeo geometry uber formats. Renderers
      typically have their own point cloud format such as RenderMan's PTC
      format and Houdini's .pc.  All of these formats share a common theme.
      They allow particles to be iterated or indexed and associate a
      customizable set of attributes with them. The goal of Partio is to
      provide a unified interface akin to unified image libraries that makes
      it easier to load, save, and manipulate particle files.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    At Walt Disney Animation Studios, we had used a mix of PDB formats, PTC
    formats and BGEO formats, depending on the authoring environments. Many of
    our tools supported more than one of these, but the code was scattered and
    copied to read these formats. Additionally, some of these formats required
    linking to large libraries to use.  For this reason we desired a library
    that could read and write all of these file formats in a simple way.  This
    would allow all of our tools to easily support all the possible formats
    that we could throw at them. It also allowed more flexibility in moving
    particles into proprietary packages without having to write an
    importer/exporter for every different tool.
  </p>

  <h2>Major Features</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Supports Houdini's GEO and BGEO, Maya's PDB and PDA, RenderMan's PTC
  <li>Arbitrary back end in-memory/cached formats can be supported from a single interface
  <li>A Python API for easy scripting of particle manipulation
  <li>A C++ API for high performance particle manipulation
  <li>Nearest Neighbor Lookups for density estimation, Voronoi computation, etc.
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Plans</h2>
  <p>
    A goal we have is to have an efficient cached and ordered format that
    allows nearest neighbor searches without an initial KD-Tree search and
    also can have only part of the particle set in memory at once.   In our
    initial version of Partio, we have not created that format, because we
    would instead like to collaborate to design the appropriate format in the
    context of open source.
